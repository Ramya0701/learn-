<h1>Covid-19 Vaccine</h1>
<p>Manish Kumar, a 34-year-old sanitation worker at Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), became the first person in India to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Almost a year after India reported its first case, on 16 January, India launched the largest vaccine drive, starting its journey on the road to recovery from a pandemic that has unconditionally disrupted and taken lives.
</p>
<h2>Vaccines protect everyone</h2>
<p> Vaccines help your immune system fight infections faster and more effectively. When you get a vaccine, it sparks your immune response, helping your body fight off and remember the germ so it can attack it if the germ ever invades again.Vaccines utilise this adaptive immunity and memory to expose the body to the antigen without causing disease, so that when then live pathogen infects the body, the response is rapid and the pathogen is prevented from causing disease.<p>
<p>Drawbacks of Covid 19 Vaccine <br></br> Vaccines are continually monitored to detect adverse events. Reported side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have mostly been mild to moderate and have lasted no longer thana few days. Typical side effects include <i><b>spain at the injection site, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills and diarrhoea.</b></i></p>
<p>However Vaccination reduced the overall attack rate to <i><b>4.6% from 9.0%</b></i> The highest relative reduction (54â€“62%) was observed among individuals aged 65 and older. Vaccination markedly reduced adverse outcomes, with non-ICU hospitalizations, ICU hospitalizations, and deaths decreasing by 63.5% </p>
